First, run install the dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
# or 
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to view the application.

The application requires the backend server located [here](https://github.com/AColocho/circle_hackathon_dash_backend).

As a proof-of-concept, the application is only designed to run using the default ports specified by the frontend and backend.
